# R-Phyllotaxis
*Showing off Some R skills by drawing flowers using the Data visualization library ggplot2 (from Datacamp)*

In this Jupyter notebook I uploaded some R code to show some of my skills with ggplot2. I loved the Phyllotaxis Project on Datacamp
which I think it delivers a very artistic way of making use of ggplot2.

If you want to develop with Phyllotaxis, read through the notebook as it will explain how nature and mathematics are deeply
intertwined when it comes to ... flower design.
